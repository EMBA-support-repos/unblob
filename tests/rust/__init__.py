# placeholder, so test files won't share the global module with files in parent director:
#
#       > import file mismatch:
#       > imported module 'test_sandbox' has this __file__ attribute:
#       >   /build/source/tests/rust/test_sandbox.py
#       > which is not the same as the test file we want to collect:
#       >   /build/source/tests/test_sandbox.py
